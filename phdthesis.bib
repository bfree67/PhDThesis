Two field tracer studies are used: the Idaho Falls tracer study and the Caltrans Highway 99 tracer study. Model performance measures are calculated using concentrations (observed and estimated) that are paired in time and space, since many of the health related questions involve outcomes associated with spatially and temporally distributed human activities. All four models showed an ability to estimate the majority of downwind concentrations within a factor of two of the observations. RLINE, AERMOD-V, and ADMS, also have the capability to predict concentrations upwind of the roadway that result from low-speed meandering of the plume. Generally, RLINE, ADMS, and \{AERMOD\} (both source types) had overall performance statistics that were broadly similar, while \{CALINE\} 3 and 4 both produced a larger degree of scatter in their concentration estimates. The models performed best for near-neutral conditions in both tracer studies, but had mixed results under convective and stable conditions. },

Various factors affect the amount of emissions produced by a heterogeneous charge diesel engine in any given situation, but these are poorly quantified in the existing literature. The parameters that most heavily affect the emissions from compression ignition engine-powered vehicles include vehicle class and weight, driving cycle, vehicle vocation, fuel type, engine exhaust aftertreatment, vehicle age, and the terrain traveled. In addition, engine control effects (such as injection timing strategies) on measured emissions can be significant. Knowing the effect of each aspect of engine and vehicle operation on the emissions from diesel engines is useful in determining methods for reducing these emissions and in assessing the need for improvement in inventory models. The effects of each of these aspects have been quantified in this paper to provide an estimate of the impact each one has on the emissions of diesel engines. },

The field measurements were used to estimate road link-based emission factors for average vehicle fleet. These factors were compared with results of an in tunnel measurement campaign (in Resalat tunnel). Roadside and in-tunnel measurements of carbon monoxide (CO) and size-fractionated particulate matter (PM) were conducted during the field campaign. The concentration gradient diagrams showed exponential decay, which represented a substantial decay, more than 50–80%, in air pollutants level in a distance between 100 and 150 meters (m) of the highway. The changes in particle size distribution by distancing from highway were also captured and evaluated. The results showed particle size distribution shifted to larger size particles by distancing from highway. The empirical emission factors were obtained by using the roadside and in tunnel measurements with a hypothetical box model, floating machine model, CALINE4, CT-EMFAC or COPERT. Average \{CO\} emission factors were estimated to be in a range of 4 to 12 g/km, and those of \{PM10\} were 0.1 to 0.2 g/km, depending on traffic conditions. Variations of these emission factors under real working condition with speeds were determined. },

Most statistical methods used for estimating spatiotemporal air quality do not account for the source characteristics (e.g. emissions). In this study, a prediction method, based on the lognormal probability distribution of hourly-average-spatial concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) obtained by a \{CALINE4\} model, has been developed and validated in an urban traffic corridor. The data on \{CO\} concentrations were collected at three locations and traffic and meteorology within the urban traffic corridor.11 Traffic corridor encompasses the entire passage bounded by the buildings on both sides including roadway with sidewalks. The method has been developed with the data of one location and validated at other two locations. The method estimated the \{CO\} concentrations reasonably well (correlation coefficient, r ≥ 0.96). Later, the method has been applied to estimate the probability of occurrence [P(C ≥ Cstd] of the spatial \{CO\} concentrations in the corridor. The results have been promising and, therefore, may be useful to quantifying spatiotemporal air quality within an urban area. },

  abstract  = {This paper uses the method of kinematic waves, developed in part I, but may be read independently. A functional relationship between flow and concentration for traffic on crowded arterial roads has been postulated for some time, and has experimental backing (section 2). From this a theory of the propagation of changes in traffic distribution along these roads may be deduced (section section 2, 3). The theory is applied (section 4) to the problem of estimating how a {\textquoteright}hump{\textquoteright}, or region of increased concentration, will move along a crowded main road. It is suggested that it will move slightly slower than the mean vehicle speed, and that vehicles passing through it will have to reduce speed rather suddenly (at a {\textquoteright}shock wave{\textquoteright}) on entering it, but can increase speed again only very gradually as they leave it. The hump gradually spreads out along the road, and the time scale of this process is estimated. The behaviour of such a hump on entering a bottleneck, which is too narrow to admit the increased flow, is studied (section 5), and methods are obtained for estimating the extent and duration of the resulting hold-up. The theory is applicable principally to traffic behaviour over a long stretch of road, but the paper concludes (section 6) with a discussion of its relevance to problems of flow near junctions, including a discussion of the starting flow at a controlled junction. In the introductory sections 1 and 2, we have included some elementary material on the quantitative study of traffic flow for the benefit of scientific readers unfamiliar with the subject.},

  abstract = {A drought forecasting model is a practical tool for drought-risk management. Drought models are used to forecast drought indices (DIs) that quantify drought by its onset, termination, and subsequent properties such as the severity, duration, and peak intensity in order to monitor and evaluate the impacts of future drought. In this study, a wavelet-based drought model using the extreme learning machine (W-ELM) algorithm where the input data are first screened through the wavelet pre-processing technique for better accuracy is developed to forecast the monthly effective DI (EDI). The EDI is an intensive index that considers water accumulation with a weighting function applied to rainfall data with the passage of time in order to analyze the drought-risk. Determined by the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial ACFs, the lagged EDI signals for the current and past months are used as significant inputs for 1 month lead-time EDI forecasting. For drought model development, 97 years of data for three hydrological stations (Bathurst Agricultural, Wilsons Promontory and Merredin in Australia) are partitioned in approximately 90:5:5 ratios for training, cross-validation and test purposes, respectively. The discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) is applied to the predictor datasets to decompose inputs into their time--frequency components that capture important information on periodicities. DWT sub-series are used to develop new EDI sub-series as inputs for the W-ELM model. The forecasting capability of W-ELM is benchmarked with ELM, artificial neural network (ANN), least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) and their wavelet-equivalent (W-ANN, W-LSSVR) models. Statistical metrics based on agreement between the forecasted and observed EDI, including the coefficient of determination, Willmott's index, Nash--Sutcliffe coefficient, percentage peak deviation, root-mean-square error, mean absolute error, and model execution time are used to assess the effectiveness of the models. The results demonstrate enhanced forecast skill of the drought models that use wavelet pre-processing of the predictor dataset. Based on statistical measures, W-ELM outperformed traditional ELM, LSSVR, ANN and their wavelet-equivalent counterparts (W-ANN, W-LSSVR). It is found that the W-ELM model is computationally efficient as shown by a faster running time with the majority of forecasting errors in lower frequency bands. The results demonstrate the usefulness of W-ELM over W-ANN and W-LSSVR models and the benefits of wavelet transformation of input data to improve the performance of drought forecasting models.},

Analysis of time-series assuming the LSW model permits identification of an evolutionary wavelet spectrum (EWS) that quantifies the variation in a time-series over a particular scale and at a particular time. We address estimation of the EWS and show how our methodology reveals phenomena of interest in an infant electrocardiogram series.},

  abstract = { Recent interest in near-road exposure to air pollutants and related health and environmental justice issues has highlighted the importance of improving the accuracy of intraurban ambient concentration estimates. Unfortunately, except in rare cases, no single source of information can accurately estimate the concentration at the desired spatial and temporal resolution over the full time period of epidemiological interest. However, it is possible to blend information from several sources so as to exploit the strengths and offset the weaknesses of each. Specifically, we are interested in combining data from ambient monitors with output from deterministic air pollution computer models. Monitor networks are sparse in both space and time, are costly to maintain, and are usually designed expressly to avoid detecting local-scale features. We use two types of computer models to compensate for these drawbacks. The first, a grid-based regional photochemical model, Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ), covers large areas at high time resolution but cannot resolve features smaller than a grid cell, usually 4, 12, or 36 km across. The second, a plume dispersion model, AMS/EPA Regulatory Model (AERMOD), can resolve these features but cannot track long-distance transport or chemical reactions. We present a new Bayesian method that combines these three sources of information to resolve the intraurban pollution field. This method represents the true latent field using a two-dimensional wavelet basis, which allows direct, efficient incorporation of data at multiple levels of resolution. It furthermore allows a priori selection of the relative importance of each data source. We test its predictive accuracy and precision in a realistic urban-scale simulation. Finally, in the context of two air pollution health studies in Atlanta, Georgia, we use our model to estimate the daily mean concentrations of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), and carbon monoxide (CO) at a mixture of census block group and zip code centroids for the years 2001–2002. Implications: This paper describes a novel method of blending regional and local model results with observations to produce accurate air pollutant concentrations at the desired spatial and temporal resolution over urban areas to support environmental epidemiological studies. },

Two distinct model runs were performed as follows: data processing using hourly-recorded time series of airborne pollutants during cold months (O3, NO2, and PM10), when residential heating increases the local emissions, and data processing using 24-h daily averaged concentrations (PM2.5) recorded between 2009 and 2012. Dataset variability was assessed using statistical analysis. Time series were passed through various FANNs. Each time series was decomposed in four time-scale components using three-level wavelets, which have been passed also through FANN, and recomposed into a single time series. The agreement between observed and modelled output was evaluated based on the statistical significance (r coefficient and correlation between errors and data). Daubechies db3 wavelet--Rprop FANN (6-4-1) utilization gave positive results for O3 time series optimizing the exclusive use of the FANN for hourly-recorded time series. NO2 was difficult to model due to time series specificity, but wavelet integration improved FANN performances. Daubechies db3 wavelet did not improve the FANN outputs for PM10 time series. Both models (FANN/WFANN) overestimated PM2.5 forecasted values in the last quarter of time series. A potential improvement of the forecasted values could be the integration of a smoothing algorithm to adjust the PM2.5 model outputs.},

When the outcome is a continuous variable, the sample size calculation requires an accurate estimate of the standard deviation of the outcome measure. A pilot trial can be used to get an estimate of the standard deviation, which could then be used to anticipate what may be observed in the main trial. However, an important consideration is that pilot trials often estimate the standard deviation parameter imprecisely. This paper looks at how we can choose an external pilot trial sample size in order to minimise the sample size of the overall clinical trial programme, that is, the pilot and the main trial together. We produce a method of calculating the optimal solution to the required pilot trial sample size when the standardised effect size for the main trial is known. However, as it may not be possible to know the standardised effect size to be used prior to the pilot trial, approximate rules are also presented. For a main trial designed with 90% power and two-sided 5% significance, we recommend pilot trial sample sizes per treatment arm of 75, 25, 15 and 10 for standardised effect sizes that are extra small (=0.1), small (0.2), medium (0.5) or large (0.8), respectively.},

The authors also present a comprehensive assessment of errors arising from use of physical parameterization schemes, and their consequent impact on model performance in a region of complex topography. An error range related to the choice of physical parameterization is provided for 2-m air temperature T2m and precipitation.Two state-of-the-art nonhydrostatic mesoscale regional climate models, the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, are used to dynamically downscale the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) to a spatial resolution of 10 km × 10 km in the European alpine region. Simulated T2m and precipitation are compared with gridded observational datasets. The model performance on regional and subregional scales is evaluated on daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual time scales.The results are based on a mixed physics ensemble of twenty-nine 1-yr-long hindcast simulations generated by choosing different model configurations. These results indicate that performance of both models is sensitive to the choice of physical parameterization and WRF is more sensitive than MM5. This sensitivity is higher during summer than during winter. The cumulus and microphysics scheme have the dominant effect on model performance during summer while boundary layer and radiation schemes affect the results during all seasons.It is found that annual mean error in the alpine region for T2m and precipitation lies between −2.75° and −1.08°C (−1.12° and 1.33°C) and 0.27 and 0.80 mm day−1 (0.13 and 1.51 mm day−1) for MM5 (WRF), respectively. The authors also found that the error range during winter for subregional scales is higher than the regional-scale error range, while during the other seasons the subregional error ranges are higher only in case of precipitation but not for T2m.These results suggest that significant reductions of errors can be achieved by choosing a suitable model configuration for the region of interest. The other outcome of these experiments is a suitable setup, which can be used to conduct further long-term high-resolution climate simulations. },

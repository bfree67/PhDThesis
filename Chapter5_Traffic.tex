\textbf{Transition to Chapter 5}

This next chapter uses the entropy theory to develop a novel application of the apportionment entropy disorder index (AEDI) to capture both spatial and temporal variability in monthly precipitation for various hydrologic modelling. In total, forty one Environment Canada stations across Ontario with long-term (1955-2005) records and very low percentage of missing data were selected. It was found that fall and summer seasons are the major contributors to annual precipitation variability. Spatial variability of annual precipitation was observed to be increasing from Southern to Northern Ontario. The AEDI index map of Ontario, developed in this study, has been successfully integrated in several hydrologic models. It has been submitted to the the peer reviewed Journal of Water Management Modeling

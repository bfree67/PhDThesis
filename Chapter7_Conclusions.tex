\chapter{Conclusions and Recommendations}

With the increase in population, there is a need for expansion of water resource development projects to include remote areas. Since the majority of these areas are ungauged or poorly gauged, models that predict flow and sediment data are essential.  This research is one of the first studies that ...The major novel academic contributions of this thesis are as follows:

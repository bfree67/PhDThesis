\chapter{Problem Description}
The purpose of this research is to advance the state of understanding for key areas in air management programs. Gaps and incomplete knowledge areas identified in the previous chapter show that specific areas should be explored. In addition to identifying knowledge gaps within literature and open access sources, practical understanding of real-world needs was identified during the development of an air management program for Kuwait under the UNDP Kuwait Integrated Environmental Management Systems (KIEMS) project \citep{UNDP2012}.  While the motivation to develop these tools were to assist regulatory agencies in developing countries, the procedures developed as a result of this research can be used to augment and reinforce mature air management programs as well.  

The main challenges identified during the KIEMS project and the literature review can be decomposed into five main research topics that are tangentially related and build off each other. The first topic, identification of air quality zone through discrimination of coastal and inland wind patterns led to the assignment of zones to improve local management of generators. The second topic of establishing classification criteria for the zones allows for long-term management of the zones.  The third topic provides a method to estimate small common emission sources distributed throughout an area that may be overlooked during emission inventories. The fourth topic supports the completion of an emissions inventory by estimating traffic densities as inputs to vehicle emission models. The last topic, predicting air quality exceedances, allows for short-term forecasts of air quality conditions within the zones. 

The relationship of each research topic to the overall framework of air quality management is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tasks}.

In the rest of this chapter, research problem statements are defined for each topic based on their impact to the overall research and need within the research community. Each section includes scoping of the problem and major assumptions.

\section{Research Needs}

Unlike other media,  air pollution is not easily quantified and changes rapidly based on weather conditions. Water quality and soil conditions can be evaluated visually through discoloration, damaged flora, and dead fauna. Soil contamination is often local with limited dispersion and migration. Air pollutants, on the other hand, can be released thousands of miles away and mix with locally produced emissions, or be transformed into secondary products that bare little resemblance to their initial state. Many of the US EPA defined HAPs are gaseous with no color or smell at harmful levels as shown in Table \ref{tb:odor} \citep{Murnane2013}. In order to determine concentration levels, air quality must be sampled and measured with complex instruments over time.

Air quality management for an area begins with one point of measurement. That point is usually a sampling tube mounted at around 10m above the ground and (hopefully) far from busy roads, exhaust vents, and smokestacks. The sample of the ambient air is therefore assumed to be well mixed and represent the prevailing blend of different upwind emissions generators, and not weighted by a nearby source. The sample is split and drawn into sensors that measure the concentration of a specific parameter (or family of parameters) over an averaging measurement period (usually every five minutes). The measurement period is aggregated into larger time weighted averages, such as 1 hr, 3 hrs, 8 hrs, or 24 hrs, for each parameter, depending on local air quality standards. 

If the average measured concentration is below the standard, the air quality is acceptable. If it is above the standard, it is an exceedance. If we accept the reasonable assumption that air quality standards are based on  toxicological studies and represent an acceptable balance between allowable pollution releases and human health, ambient air quality concentrations become the measure of performance for air quality.

Just as one sample cannot adequately represent a complex population in statistics, one air monitoring station cannot adequately represent a country with complex topographies, urban centers, industrial activities, transportation networks, weather patterns, and proximity to neighbors with their complex environments.  In short, the air quality in one part of the country will most likely be different from the other parts. For regulatory agencies with limited staff and budget, prioritizing areas with poor air quality is a more efficient use of resources than applying the same enforcement standards uniformly. Identifying areas for enforcement jurisdiction is, therefore, an important basis of an air management program. As shown in the previous chapter, initial zones were usually established using existing political boundaries without consideration of micro-climate effects based on geography and land use.  

\subsection{Area of Study}
Most of the data used in this research were collected in the State of Kuwait from 2012 to 2017. Kuwait is a small country of 17,818 km$^{2}$ located on the northwest corner of the Persian Gulf, between longitudes 46.56$^{o}$ – 48.37$^{o}$ East and latitudes 28.51$^{o}$ - 30.16$^{o}$ North with over 499 km of coastline \citep{CIA2015}. It is bordered by Iraq to the north and Saudi Arabia to the south and west. The country is classified as a desert zone with the highest altitude reaching only 300 meters above sea level.   In 2011, approximately 3.1 million people lived in Kuwait \citep{CSB2017} with over 64\% of its annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) coming from the production of hydrocarbons \citep{KAMCO2013}.  Other industries in Kuwait include power generation and water desalination using heavy oil and natural gas at five sites, steel making using electrical induction furnaces, and food preparation.  The country has over 7,400 km of paved roads and over 1.8 million cars in service \citep{CSB2014}.  Over 98\% of the population lives within 10 km of the coast and are subject to coastal effect winds, caused by the diurnal differential heating/cooling of the sea and land \citep{Crosman2010, Cuxart2014}.  The land-sea breezes (LSB) shift direction and speed over the course of the day, re-circulating pollution back and forth from land sources.

The Kuwait Environment Public Authority (KEPA) is responsible for monitoring environmental conditions and enforcing compliance with the national environmental law. It operates 15 each fixed site AMS’s located along the coast as shown in Fig \ref{fig1:amskuwait}.  The KEPA stations measure and report 1 hour averaged air pollutants and meteorological conditions. The bulk of the AMSs are located within two air quality zones (Central and Southern Coast) which correspond to areas of high population and industrial centers. Access to monitoring data from additional stations operated by the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) provides an air monitoring density of approximately one monitoring station per 163,150 people. This density is similar to Vancouver, Canada which has approximately 1 per 160,000 people, as compared to around 1 per 440,000 people in the South Coast of California \citep{Marshall2008}.

\section{Specific topics required within air management}
As noted above, air management requires many individual processes that are linked together. This thesis investigates methods to address five specific processes within the overall framework of air management using advanced stochastic modeling and machine learning techniques.

\subsection{Air zone mapping}

In this topic, we develop a novel procedure to identify common dispersion areas with a designated region or country using the assumption that land-sea breezes (LSBs) provide different circulatory wind patterns than inland wind. As part of the methodology, we only consider dispersion patterns at ground level, and not at different altitudes. By identifying common mixing zones within a larger airshed, regulatory policies can be tailored to address zone-based problems that might not be applicable or required to other zones. Targeted processes allow resources to be prioritized and reduce economic impacts to sources outside of zones that are in non-attainment of air quality standards.

\subsection{Attainment classification}

Once zones are established, methods are required to convert the measured concentration data from air monitoring stations into management action. A single monitoring station might register high readings that exceed the established standard for the parameter. Assuming the sensor is calibrated and operating properly, the question becomes how many exceedances are allowable before direct action is taken to reduce generator emissions - thereby impacting economic production by cutting operations, expending capital to improve processes, or changing transportation habits by limiting private vehicle operation. These exceedances may be only three exceedances per year, as is the case for O$_{3}$ in the USA, or 2.5 million premature deaths, as is the case in India \citep{Landrigan2017}.

In this topic, we developed a novel method to evaluate the effectiveness of exceedance determination methods, especially if there are multiple air monitoring stations within the zone. Methods were developed to evaluate an area with only one monitoring station and areas with multiple stations. Only two classifications methodologies were evaluated, although it is general enough to assess any classification approach. The USEPA's Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) approach was used to develop the procedure, along with assumptions on body weight, inhalation rates, and exposure duration. 

\subsection{Dispersed area sources}

A key requirement in air management is to understand where pollutants come from in order to impact the processes that generate them. Pollutant source evaluation requires an emissions inventory of sources that includes rates of emission for individual analytes, physical parameters of the release point such as height, release temperature, release velocity, and area of release, as well as the geospatial location of the emission source. It also helps to include an industrial code of the source to evaluate processes within a sector, and an emission source code to group common emission processes \citep{The2008}.

Collection of emission rate data is often challenging as the rates are time dependent based seasonal, diurnal, weekly and production schedules. Emissions are also impacted by the quality of feedstock (\% of sulfur or ash in the material). Accurate collection of real-time emissions using continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) are limited only to the analytes being measured and to large sources that can afford to install and operate these systems. Other techniques use some form of parametric emission factor equation - whether local factors that include operational data from a process historian capturing fuel rates, operating temperatures, and combustion efficiencies, or published emission factors such as USEPA's AP-42 that use an input feedstock \citep{USEPA1995}. While some of the AP-42 factors are rated as high quality (B or better), they are nonetheless outdated (published in 1995) and incomplete (despite over 12,000 published factors).

While most EFs were developed to characterize stationary sources, many EFs also provide values for area sources. The area sources are assumed to be local and associated with a specific organization. In many non-industrial or commercial scenarios, small sources exist that aggregate to a significant annual amount when taken together.  These sources may be spread throughout the country (or zones), such as smoking or grilling.

In this research, we look at small sources by evaluating the impact of emission contributions from $nargyla$ water pipes in restaurants and caf\'es. We assume that there are a set number of establishments and only consider non-personal uses.  Monte Carlo Analysis is used to represent ranges of uncertainty and variations within data sets. Emission factors were selected from the published literature.

\subsection{Vehicle density estimation in congested environments}

Mobile sources contribute a significant amount of emissions in most countries but are difficult to quantify due to a large number of variables and parameters required for calculation. Essential parameters for estimating total mobile source emission contributions to the emissions inventory includes identifying the types and quantities of vehicles using road segments at particular times of the day to prepare a reasonable model of activity that can then be used to calculate emissions. Evaluating traffic at an intersection allows for discrete analysis of vehicles regarding fleet composition, as well as providing emissions generated during idling and accelerating from rest.

Using a commercial drone and DEM generating software, 3D models were generated of traffic at signalized intersections. The vehicle type was identified to build a fleet composition model and inter-vehicle stacking gaps were measured to create a model that could estimate the number and types of vehicles on a discrete road segment. These values can be used as inputs to more complex mobile emission models.

I would like to thank a number of people who have supported me throughout these 4 years and made it possible for me to complete this thesis.  

First and foremost I would like to thank Dr. Bahram Gharabaghi who has been a very dedicated supervisor and an amazing mentor. He has been a constant source of inspiration with valuable feedback throughout my studies. I appreciate him finding the time to meet with me every week and whenever I required help.
